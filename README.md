Sample Smartphone ID Manager
=================================

Sample of a user-friendly interface for self-sovereign identity management as described in my master thesis [Towards self-sovereign identity using blockchain technology.](http://essay.utwente.nl/71274/)

Improved version over initial proof-of-concept (still in progress)

* Refactor from Ionic v2 beta 8 to Ionic RC2 (and angular 2 final!)
* Refactor from ES6 to TypeScript
